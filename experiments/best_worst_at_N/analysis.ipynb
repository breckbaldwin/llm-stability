    "# What is Best/Worst Possible Accuracy with Choose n from N?\n",

    "\n",
    "A reviewer asked for a graph of the best/worst accuracy at various N values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Non-trivial issue since there are 10 ways with N=1 and 10 runs, N choose 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of ways to choose $n$ items from $N$ is given by $\\binom{N}{n} = \\frac{N!}{n!(N - n)!}$. This will allow for every $n$ except 1 to have the worst/best case as one of the choices so not a useful graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll graph instead the worst/best case for up to run $n$ which should achieve the intended effect. \n",

         " A: The most proactive approach to addressing negative or misleading information posted online about your organization is to make policy changes to address complaints highlighted on these sites. This shows that the organization is responsive to criticism and is committed to addressing the concerns of its stakeholders.\n\nA: A situation analysis is typically carried out at the defining stage of the planning process. This involves assessing the current situation, identifying key issues, and determining the target audience and their perceptions.\n\nC: During the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican's response was characterized by a perception that criticisms were taken as attacks on the Catholic Church. This was not a proactive or coordinated media response, and it did not result in the credibility of the Vatican being upheld.\n\nC: If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, the best course of action is to say 'I don't know' and promise to provide the information later. This is preferable to giving the reporter incorrect information, saying that the information is 'off the record,' or saying 'no comment.'\n\nC: In the situation described, the vice president of public relations for the corporation should recommend stopping sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issuing a recall for that product. This will help to contain the problem and prevent it from becoming a national public relations disaster. It is important to quickly investigate the situation to make certain that the product is definitely the cause of the illness, but this should be done in addition to taking immediate action to stop sales and issue a recall. Issuing a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms is not a sufficient response to this situation.",

         " A: The answer is (D). The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched the Earth Hour campaign.\n\nD: The answer is (D). The most proactive approach to addressing negative or misleading information posted online about your organization is to make policy changes to address complaints highlighted on these sites. This shows that your organization is listening to the concerns being raised and is taking action to address them.\n\nA: The answer is (A). A situation analysis would typically be carried out at the stage of defining the program in the planning process. This involves assessing the current situation and identifying any issues or challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve the goals of the program.\n\nC: The answer is (C). At the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican's response was characterized by a perception that criticisms were taken as attacks on the Catholic Church. This is not an effective approach to managing a crisis, as it can come across as defensive and dismissive of valid concerns.\n\nC: The answer is (C). If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, the best course of action is to say 'I don't know' and promise to provide the information later. This is preferable to providing inaccurate or misleading information, or attempting to deflect the question.\n\nD: The answer is (D). Idea-oriented advertising campaigns are focused on gathering support for a particular message or cause. These campaigns aim to promote a specific idea or concept, rather than a product or service.",

This is because staying informed about the organization's current and future circumstances allows the PR counselor to develop effective strategies and tactics that align with the organization's goals and objectives.

         " A: The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched the Earth Hour campaign.\n\nD: The most proactive approach to addressing negative or misleading information posted online about your organization is to make policy changes to address complaints highlighted on these sites. This shows that your organization is listening to the concerns of its stakeholders and is willing to take action to address them.\n\nA: A situation analysis is typically carried out at the defining stage of the planning process. This involves assessing the current situation and identifying any issues or challenges that may need to be addressed in the planning process.\n\nC: At the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican's response was characterized by a perception that criticisms were taken as attacks on the Catholic Church. This is an example of the \"spiral of silence,\" in which people are less likely to speak up about their opinions if they believe they are in the minority or if they fear negative consequences for expressing their views.\n\nC: If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, the best course of action is to say \"I don't know\" and promise to provide the information later. It is important to be honest and transparent with the media, and trying to cover up a lack of knowledge by providing incorrect information or making vague statements can damage credibility and harm relationships with reporters.",

         " A: The answer is (B). In issues management, the most proactive approach to addressing negative or misleading information posted online about your organization is to make policy changes to address complaints highlighted on these sites. This demonstrates a commitment to addressing the root cause of the issue and can help to rebuild trust with stakeholders.\n\nA: The answer is (A). A situation analysis is carried out at the defining stage of the planning process. This involves assessing the current situation, identifying key issues and stakeholders, and understanding the organizational context. This information is then used to inform the development of the program.\n\nA: The answer is (C). At the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican's response was characterized by a perception of criticisms as attacks on the Catholic Church. This approach was not effective in addressing the issue and contributed to the erosion of the Vatican's credibility.\n\nA: The answer is (B). If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, the best course of action is to say 'I don't know' and promise to provide the information later. This is preferable to providing inaccurate or misleading information, or attempting to deflect the question.\n\nA: The answer is (B). The statement \"They both deal with acute risks\" is not true of both issues management and crisis management. Issues management deals with both acute and chronic risks, while crisis management deals specifically with acute risks that have the potential to cause significant harm to an organization.",

This shows that the organization is listening to the concerns of its stakeholders and is willing to take action to address them.\n\nA: A situation analysis is typically carried out at the defining stage of the planning process. This involves assessing the current situation and identifying any issues or challenges that need to be addressed in the planning process.\n\nC: At the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican was criticized for treating criticisms as attacks on the Catholic Church rather than addressing the issues in a coordinated and consistent manner.\n\nC: If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, she should say \"I don't know\" and promise to provide the information later. It is important to be honest and transparent with the media, rather than trying to cover up a lack of knowledge.\n\nC: Current thinking about mass communication suggests that audiences are not passive recipients of media messages, but rather active receivers who interpret and respond to messages in their own ways. This means that different people may be affected differently by the same mass communication message, depending on their individual perspectives and experiences.",

This shows that your organization is listening to the concerns of its stakeholders and is willing to take action to address them.\n\nA: A situation analysis is typically carried out at the defining stage of the planning process. This involves conducting research to understand the current situation, including the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing the organization.\n\nC: At the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican's response was characterized by a lack of coordination and consistency in its messaging. Criticisms were taken as attacks on the Catholic Church, and the credibility of the Vatican was not upheld.\n\nC: If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, the best course of action is to say 'I don't know' and promise to provide the information later. It is important to be honest and transparent with reporters, and not to provide misinformation or speculation.\n\n(C) Michael E.

You are the community relations director for a public water utility that has been targeted by a group of activists opposed to adding fluoride to drinking water. The activists are waging an intense internet campaign against the practice. Your utility has overwhelming evidence of the health benefits to fluoridated water. The manager of the utility asks you to initiate a blog to get the health message out.

(B) Recruit a group of volunteer dentists and physicians to write the blog under their own identities with no reference to the utility.. (C) Write the blog yourself, identifying yourself as an employee of the utility, and quote the scientific opinions of a variety of sources.. (D) Compensate a group of dentists and physicians to write the blog, identifying the utility as the sponsor of the blog but without disclosing the compensation.. \"}]",

         " A: The most appropriate course of action would be to recruit a group of volunteer dentists and physicians to write the blog under their own identities with no reference to the utility. This approach ensures that the information shared is credible and trustworthy, as it comes from qualified professionals in the field. It also allows for transparency, as the utility's role in sponsoring the blog is disclosed. Using utility employees to pose as dentists and physicians, compensating professionals to write the blog without disclosing the compensation, or writing the blog yourself without disclosing your affiliation with the utility could all potentially damage the utility's credibility and reputation.",

         " A: The Earth Hour campaign was launched by the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nD: The most proactive approach to addressing negative or misleading information posted online about your organization is to make policy changes to address complaints highlighted on these sites. This demonstrates a commitment to addressing the concerns of stakeholders and improving the organization's practices.\n\nA: A situation analysis is carried out at the defining stage of the planning process. This analysis helps to identify the current state of the organization and its environment, and informs the development of program goals and objectives.\n\nC: At the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican's response was characterized by a failure to consistently communicate messages and a tendency to view criticisms as attacks on the Catholic Church. This approach undermined the Vatican's credibility and exacerbated the situation.\n\nC: If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, she should say 'I don't know' and promise to provide the information later. This is a more honest and transparent approach than providing inaccurate information or refusing to comment.\n\nC: Public affairs is an area of public relations that is likely to involve lobbying. Public affairs professionals work to build and maintain relationships with policymakers and other stakeholders in order to advance the interests of their organization. This may involve lobbying for legislation or regulations that benefit the organization, or opposing measures that would harm it.",

         " A: The answer is (B). Earth Hour was a campaign launched by the World Wildlife Fund to encourage individuals, communities, and businesses to turn off non-essential electric lights for one hour, from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. (DST, local time), as a symbol of their commitment to the planet.\n\nD: The answer is (D). The most proactive approach to addressing negative or misleading information posted online about your organization is to make policy changes to address complaints highlighted on these sites. This approach demonstrates a commitment to addressing the root cause of the issue and shows that the organization is responsive to feedback.\n\nA: The answer is (A). A situation analysis is carried out at the defining stage of the planning process. This analysis involves assessing the internal and external factors that may impact the program, including stakeholder perceptions, organizational strengths and weaknesses, and the broader social, political, and economic context.\n\nC: The answer is (C). At the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican's response was characterized by a defensive posture, with criticisms being taken as attacks on the Catholic Church. This approach undermined the credibility of the Vatican and hindered its ability to effectively address the issue.\n\nC: The answer is (C). If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, the best approach is to say 'I don't know' and promise to provide the information later. This approach demonstrates honesty and transparency, and helps to build trust with the reporter.\n\nB: The answer is (B). A book launch is a common tactic used to promote a new book and generate interest among potential readers. This tactic typically involves hosting an event where the author can speak about the book, answer questions, and sign copies for attendees.",

         " A: The Vatican, at the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, treated the criticisms as attacks on the Catholic Church rather than addressing the issue and coordinating a media response with consistent messages. This approach damaged their credibility and their reputation.\n\nA: If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, she should say \"I don't know\" and promise to provide the information later. It is better to admit ignorance than to provide inaccurate information or deceive the reporter.\n\nA: The most significant Internet-related challenge in the public relations field is staying abreast of changing technology. The rapid pace of technological change requires public relations professionals to continually update their skills and knowledge in order to effectively communicate with and engage their audiences. Representing clients using new social media environments, finding stable, cost-effective Internet providers, and training staff to use social media are also important considerations, but staying current with technology is the overarching challenge.",

         " A: The answer is (D). The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched the Earth Hour campaign.\n\nD: The most proactive approach to addressing negative or misleading information posted online about your organization is to make policy changes to address complaints highlighted on these sites. This shows that your organization is listening to the concerns of its stakeholders and is willing to take action to address them.\n\nA: A situation analysis is typically carried out at the defining stage of the planning process. This involves conducting research to understand the current situation and identify any potential challenges or opportunities that may impact the success of the program.\n\nC: At the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican's response was characterized by a lack of coordination and consistency in its messaging. Criticisms were taken as attacks on the Catholic Church, and the credibility of the Vatican was not upheld.\n\nC: If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, the best course of action is to say 'I don't know' and promise to provide the information later. It is important to be honest and transparent with reporters, as trying to provide incorrect or incomplete information can damage your organization's credibility.\n\nD: Viral campaigns are a guerrilla marketing technique that involves the spreading of a message about a product, issue, or service through online peer-to-peer communication. This can be an effective way to reach a large audience quickly and cost-effectively.",

         " A: The answer is (C). In issues management, the most proactive approach to addressing negative or misleading information posted online about your organization is to make policy changes to address complaints highlighted on these sites. This demonstrates a commitment to addressing the root cause of the issue and shows that the organization is responsive to feedback.\n\nA: The answer is (A). A situation analysis is carried out at the defining program stage in the planning process. This analysis involves assessing the current situation, identifying key issues, and understanding the target audience. It helps to inform the development of the communication strategy and ensures that the program is relevant and effective.\n\nA: The answer is (C). At the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican's response was characterized by a perception that criticisms were taken as attacks on the Catholic Church. This approach was not effective in addressing the issue and instead served to further damage the Vatican's credibility.\n\nA: The answer is (C). If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, the best course of action is to say 'I don't know' and promise to provide the information later. This approach is honest and transparent, and it helps to build trust with the reporter.\n\nA: The answer is (C). Open-ended survey questions seek qualitative information. These questions allow respondents to provide detailed and nuanced responses, rather than simply selecting from a set of pre-determined options. This type of question can provide valuable insights into attitudes, opinions, and experiences.",

         " A: The answer is (D). The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched the Earth Hour campaign.\n\nD: The most proactive approach to addressing negative or misleading information posted online about your organization is to make policy changes to address complaints highlighted on these sites. This shows that your organization is listening to the concerns of its stakeholders and is willing to take action to address them.\n\nA: A situation analysis is typically carried out at the defining stage of the planning process. This involves conducting research to understand the current situation, including any challenges or opportunities that may exist.\n\nC: At the time of the accusations of child abuse cover-ups in 2010, the Vatican's response was characterized by a defensive attitude, with criticisms being taken as attacks on the Catholic Church. This made it difficult for the Vatican to effectively communicate its message and maintain its credibility.\n\nC: If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, the best course of action is to say 'I don't know' and promise to provide the information later. This is preferable to providing inaccurate information or attempting to dodge the question.\n\nB: Approximately half of all public relations practitioners work in business and commercial areas. This includes roles in industries such as technology, finance, and consumer goods.",

This approach was not effective in addressing the concerns of stakeholders and upholding the credibility of the Vatican.\n\nC: If a public relations media practitioner does not know the answer to a reporter's question, she should say \"I don't know\" and promise to provide the information later. This is a transparent and honest approach that builds trust and credibility with the reporter and the audience.\n\nA: According to Macnamara's (2005) pyramid of evaluation, the situation analysis is done at the inputs stage.
