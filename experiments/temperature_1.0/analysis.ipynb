The set of rational numbers is countable, and the Cartesian product of two countable sets is also countable. Therefore, the complement of \\( S \\) is countable and hence not open in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). Thus, \\( S \\) is not closed.\n",

      "3. **Connected**: A set is connected if it cannot be partitioned into two nonempty disjoint open sets. The set \\( S \\) is dense in \\([0, 1] \\times [0, 1]\\) because between any two points in the unit square, we can find points with irrational coordinates.

Since the coefficients are in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), there are 5 constant polynomials (one for each element of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\)).

      "1. **Closed**: A set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of \\( S \\) consists of points where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are rational.
